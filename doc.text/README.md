## Converting to DOCX Format

### Option 1: Using Microsoft Word

1. Open Microsoft Word
2. For each Markdown file:
   - Open the file in a text editor
   - Copy all content
   - In Word, paste the content
   - Word should automatically convert most Markdown formatting
   - Adjust any formatting as needed
   - Save each chapter as a separate DOCX file

3. Combine all chapters:
   - Create a new Word document
   - Insert each chapter using Insert > Object > Text from File
   - Arrange chapters in the correct order
   - Add page breaks between chapters
   - Apply consistent formatting and styles
   - Add cover page using the Greenwich template
   - Update the Table of Contents

### Option 2: Using Online Converters

Several online tools can convert Markdown to DOCX:

1. **Pandoc** (Command-line tool, most powerful option):
   ```
   pandoc acknowledgements.md chapter1_introduction.md chapter2_literature_review.md ... -o final_report.docx
   ```

2. **Online Converters**:
   - [Markdown to DOCX Converter](https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-docx)
   - [Aspose Markdown to DOCX](https://products.aspose.app/words/conversion/markdown-to-word)
   - [Word to Markdown Converter](https://word2md.com/) (can also convert back from Markdown to Word)

3. After conversion, you'll likely need to:
   - Apply the Greenwich template formatting
   - Add the cover page
   - Check and adjust formatting for consistency
   - Update references and citations
   - Generate the final Table of Contents

### Option 3: Using Google Docs

1. For each Markdown file:
   - Open a new Google Doc
   - Copy and paste the Markdown content
   - Use the "Formatting" options to fix any issues
   - Download as a DOCX file

2. Combine all documents into a single file using Word as described in Option 1.

## Placeholder Images

Note that Chapter 6 includes placeholder references for screenshots. You'll need to:

1. Replace `placeholder_for_auth_screenshot.png` with actual screenshots of your application
2. Ensure all images are properly captioned and referenced in the text
3. Maintain consistent image sizing and formatting throughout the document
