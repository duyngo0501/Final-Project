      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Core Infrastructure Setup task into subtasks covering server configuration, database setup, caching implementation, CI/CD pipeline creation, security configuration, and monitoring setup. For each subtask, specify the specific technologies to be used and key configuration parameters.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple complex infrastructure components including servers, databases, caching, and CI/CD pipelines. Each component requires specialized knowledge and careful configuration. The task is foundational for the entire project and has medium-high complexity due to the breadth of technologies involved and potential for integration challenges."

      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Core Feature Implementation task into specific functional components based on the application's primary use cases. For each subtask, define the specific functionality, data models involved, API endpoints needed, and integration points with other system components.",
      "reasoning": "This task is extremely broad and encompasses the main functionality of the entire application. Without more specific details, it's difficult to fully assess, but implementing core features typically involves complex business logic, data modeling, and integration across multiple components. The high priority and dependency on multiple previous tasks indicates its central importance to the project."

For each subtask, specify the specific commands and examples to be included.",
      "reasoning": "This is a focused documentation task with clearly defined sections. While comprehensive, it's primarily about organizing and presenting information about Alembic rather than implementing technical functionality. The medium priority and lack of dependencies indicate it can be completed independently."

For each subtask, specify the code examples and explanations to be included.",
      "reasoning": "This documentation task is more complex than the Alembic one due to the broader scope of SQLAlchemy ORM functionality. It requires organizing and explaining multiple concepts with appropriate code examples. However, it remains primarily a documentation task rather than implementation, keeping the complexity moderate."
